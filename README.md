# Password-Protected-Door-Lock-System-using-Arduino
This project implements a password-protected door lock system using an Arduino microcontroller. The system utilizes a 4x4 matrix keypad for password input and an electronic lock mechanism controlled by the Arduino. When it is correct password, the Arduino unlock the door. If it is incorrect password, the system trigger a buzzer alarm.
